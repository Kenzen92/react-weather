Introduction
WeatherApp is a web application that allows users to view weather information for a given location. The application utilizes React components to display the weather data, including current weather, today's forecast, and a ten-day forecast.

Features
Current Weather: Display the current weather information for the selected location.
Today's Forecast: Show a detailed forecast for the current day.
Ten-Day Forecast: Provide a forecast for the next ten days.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the WeatherApp locally:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd weather-app
Install the required dependencies:

bash

Usage
To use the WeatherApp, you need to provide the latitude (lat), longitude (lon), and location name when rendering the WeatherComponent in your application. Here's an example of how to use the WeatherComponent:

jsx
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import WeatherComponent from './path-to-WeatherComponent/WeatherComponent';

function App() {
  const lat = 40.7128; // Replace with your desired latitude
  const lon = -74.0060; // Replace with your desired longitude
  const locationName = 'New York City'; // Replace with your desired location name

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <WeatherComponent lat={lat} lon={lon} locationName={locationName} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Make sure to replace the latitude, longitude, and location name with the appropriate values.

API Key
The WeatherApp fetches weather data from an external API. To use the API, you need to provide an API key. Follow these steps:

Sign up or log in to the Visual Crossing Weather API.
Once logged in, navigate to the API key section and generate a new API key.
Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the project and add your API key as follows:

env
Copy code
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-api-key
Replace your-api-key with the API key you generated.

Note: Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.
